# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery keeps the project on schedule.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology is an Iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development.Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
Waterfall methodology is a Linear and sequential approach.Each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Disadvantages of agile methodology: - Less predictability, Requires significant customer involvement.
advantages of waterfall methodology: Clear structure and documentation, Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
disadvantages of waterfall methodology: Difficult to accommodate changes, Testing occurs late in the process.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is ideal for projects with unknowns and high risk. example include a product design.
Waterfall is suited for projects with concrete timeline and well-defined delivariables. example include: manufacturing project

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
methods includes: failure testing, total quality management and statistical project control.
